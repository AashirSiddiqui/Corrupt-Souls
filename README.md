# Corrupt Souls

Use arrow keys to move around and dodge the enemies and soul stars.
Made with Pygame 2.0.1 and Python 3.9

Don't want to download but still want to play? I will put the game on replit.com soon.
Advantages of playing in the browser:
- Get updates before they are realeased to the GitHub
- No need to download python and pygame.
Disadvantages:
- Sometimes you will get half-updates
- Way slower than the download version
